# CommonMark [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/drforr/perl6-CommonMark.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/drforr/perl6-CommonMark)
CommonMark
=======

Parser and basic AST for CommonMark spec.

If you're concerned about compatibility, it's Markdown but with an actual spec. The Markdown "spec" file leaves many edge cases open to interpretation.

* Using zef (a module management tool bundled with Rakudo Star):

```
    zef update && zef install CommonMar
```

## Testing

To run tests:

```
    prove -e perl6
```
